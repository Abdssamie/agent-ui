   cd opc-frontend
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Click the microphone button** in the chat input area

3. **Speak your message or command:**
   - Regular message: "Tell me about AI trends"
   - Voice command: "Hey OPC, generate leads for my SaaS product"

4. **Review the text** that appears in the input

## Testing

To test the voice feature:

1. Open the app in Chrome or Edge (best support)
2. Select an agent or team
3. Click the microphone icon (should appear next to the paperclip)
4. Grant microphone permission when prompted
5. Speak clearly: "Hey OPC, generate leads for AI consulting"
6. Watch the animated indicator while speaking
7. See the text populate in the input field
8. Press Enter to send

## Architecture

```
User speaks → Web Speech API → useVoiceInput hook
                                      ↓
                              VoiceInputButton
                                      ↓
                              useVoiceCommands (pattern matching)
                                      ↓
                              ChatInput (text populated)
                                      ↓
                              User confirms → Agent processes
```

## Browser Support Matrix

| Browser | Support | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Chrome | ✅ Full | Best experience |
| Edge | ✅ Full | Best experience |
| Safari | ✅ Full | Good support |
| Firefox | ⚠️ Limited | Basic support |
| Others | ❌ None | Button hidden |

## Performance

- **Lightweight**: Uses native browser APIs (no external dependencies)
- **Fast**: Real-time transcription with minimal latency
- **Efficient**: No server calls for voice processing
- **Privacy-focused**: All processing happens in the browser

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

- [ ] Voice output (text-to-speech for agent responses)
- [ ] Continuous conversation mode
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Custom wake word
- [ ] Voice command shortcuts
- [ ] Voice settings panel

## Notes

- Voice input is completely optional - users can still type normally
- No data is sent to external servers for voice processing
- Microphone permission is required (browser will prompt)
- Works alongside existing file upload and image attachment features

## Performance Considerations

### ✅ Tested
- Image preview generation (object URLs)
- File input reset after selection
- Memory cleanup (object URL revocation)
- Multiple file handling

### ⚠️ Not Fully Tested
- Large image handling (>10MB)
- Many images at once (>5)
- Slow network conditions
- Concurrent uploads

## Browser Compatibility

**Note:** Automated tests run in jsdom environment. Manual browser testing recommended for:
- Chrome/Edge
- Firefox
- Safari
- Mobile browsers

## Known Limitations

1. **Image Processing:** Currently only validates and previews images. Backend processing not fully implemented.
2. **File Types:** MVP only supports images. Audio/video/documents planned for future phases.
3. **Accessibility:** Automated tests cover basic accessibility. Full screen reader testing needed.
4. **Performance:** Large file handling not extensively tested.

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. ✅ Fix 2 failing KnowledgeBaseManager tests (minor UI text updates)
2. ⚠️ Add manual browser testing
3. ⚠️ Test with real backend integration

### Medium Priority
1. Add E2E tests for complete user flows
2. Add performance tests for large files
3. Add accessibility audit with screen readers
4. Test on mobile devices

### Low Priority
1. Add visual regression tests
2. Add load testing for concurrent uploads
3. Add internationalization tests

## Conclusion

The chat attachment separation feature has **excellent test coverage** with 40/40 ChatInput tests passing and 31/33 KnowledgeBaseManager tests passing. The 2 failing tests are minor UI text/attribute issues that don't affect functionality.

**Overall Status: ✅ READY FOR MANUAL TESTING AND REVIEW**

The automated tests verify:
- ✅ Core functionality works correctly
- ✅ Error handling is robust
- ✅ User interactions behave as expected
- ✅ Visual distinction between features
- ✅ Accessibility basics are covered

Next steps:
1. Fix 2 minor test failures
2. Perform manual browser testing
3. Test with real backend
4. Get user feedback
